# Graph Algorithms

I really like graphs. They have a soothing quality to them that I enjoy. They are self-contained, they are chill. They are cool. However, I know very little about them. I wanna change that. So I'm gonna try and implement some algorithms walking through them.

This repo is inspired by the book Graph Algorithms, by Shimon Even. The code, I'd love to be able to say that it was all from my tiny brain, but it is not. My main inspiration is `https://github.com/illiterati1/python_maze/`, where the author implements what the *Tremaux* algorithm (the first one I've tried to implement) for the purpose it's best known for, which is maze solving. Anyways, I've gotten some ideas about how to structure the code from there, so feel free to check it out.
