# Depth-First Search Algorithms

## Tr√©maux Algorithm

In the book I'm using to study about graph algorithms this one is really poorly explained (in the pseudocode, it skips many important parts). A whole day just to get a grasp on how it works. I think it's an algorithm that is better suited for working with mazes. The book is **Graph Algorithms** by *Even*, *Shimon*
